## AggressorScripts

Collection of scripts that I created, as well as scripts from others that found useful.

**Seatbelt.cna**
- An agressor script that I created so I can easily run Seatbelt from the GUI.
- **Note:** Modify the value of the `$assembly` variable first and point it to the location of the Seatbelt binary.

**Sharphound.cna**
- An agressor script that I created so I can easily run Sharphound from the GUI.
- **Note:** Modify the value of the `$assembly` variable first and point it to the location of the Sharphound binary.
